    <h1>Plant Care Reminder</h1>
    <h2>Overview/Vision</h2>
    <p>
        It is hard to stay on schedule when caring for houseplants. This would be a plant care reminder app where users
        can add their existing plants and track the watering, fertilizing and re-pottong schedules. There would also be
        links to other sites where further plant care information can be sourced as to each particular plant.
    </p>
    <h2>User Stories</h2>
    <div class="userStories">

    <ol class="myOl">
        <li>As a user, I want to be able to track each plants watering schedule</li>
        <li>As a user, I want to be able to track each plants fertilization schedule</li>
        <li>As a user, I want to be able to log when a plant has been re-potted</li>
        <li>As a user, I want to have links to plant help websites</li>
        <li>As a user, I would like there to be a place to store other information on each plant</li>
        <li>As a user, I want an alert to come up when a plant is overdue for water</li>
        <li>As a user, I want an alert to come up when a plant is overdue for fertilizer</li>
        <li>As a user I should be able to see the plants water schedule</li>
        <li>As a user, I should be able to see the plants fertilization schedule</li>
        <li>As a user, i'd like there to be a suggested product section to help plants</li>
        <li>As a user, there should be links to local plant stores to get plant products</li>
    </ol>
    </div>
    <h2>Firebase Usage</h2>
    <p>
        This app will use the Firebase database to store the plants watering and fertilization inputs and work with a
        set timeout function to alert the user on pageload if they are behind schedule. It will also allow users to add
        new plants to their app and update it along the way.
